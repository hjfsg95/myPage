        <p>hi i'm Jing, I am doing my master degree of statistics here at UIUC, and I just completed my first year of study. I did my undergraduate in Xiamen University, in China, majoring in financial engineering. I switched my major to statistics because I am interested in data analysis of biomedical data, and I think this gives me a feeling of helping people, and biomedical data analysis is often very challenging. I have knowledge in mathematical statistics, machine learning and I can code very fluently with R. I have experience in dealing with gene expression levels data, images and texts. I am particularly interested in genomic data, it's large, it's high dimensional, and there is a lot to be discovered in the datasets. Unlike other data analysis that aims to do prediction or classification, it's sometimes more important to do causal inferece in this field, like finding causes of disease. And this requires a lot of statistical work. That's the reason why I am applying to this position, I think it's a good chance for me to gain research experiences, read relevant papers and talk to professional people. And I can figure out if or not I really want to go for a phd in biostat. </p>
